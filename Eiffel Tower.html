					The Eiffel Tower, one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world,
					stands proudly in Paris, France. It was built for the 1889 Exposition
					Universelle (World’s Fair), an event celebrating the 100th anniversary
					of the French Revolution. Designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel, the
					tower was originally criticized by artists and intellectuals who
					thought it looked strange and unnecessary. However, after its
					completion, it quickly became a symbol of modern engineering and a
					beloved icon of France.

					Standing at 324 meters tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made
					structure in the world for over 40 years. It is made of iron and
					consists of three main levels accessible by elevators or stairs. The
					tower’s design is both elegant and extremely strong, capable of
					withstanding powerful winds thanks to its open lattice structure.

					At night, the Eiffel Tower lights up the Paris sky with thousands of
					sparkling lights, making it one of the most photographed monuments on
					Earth. Today, it welcomes over 7 million visitors each year, offering
					breathtaking views of the city from its observation decks. More than
					just a tourist attraction, the Eiffel Tower stands as a symbol of
					innovation, creativity, and the cultural beauty of Paris.
